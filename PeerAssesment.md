I confidently rate both team members as 5 out of 5 across all evaluation criteria.


Self-Assessment – Project Manager & Ethics Lead

In this project, I served as the Project Manager and the Ethics Lead. My responsibilities centered on organizing the workflow, ensuring communication remained clear, and maintaining the ethical standards guiding our development process. I approached the project with the goal of keeping the group aligned, on schedule, and accountable for both the technical and ethical expectations of the assignment.

From a project management standpoint, I believe I performed strongly. I established structure when the project began, clarified roles, and helped maintain direction when tasks needed adjustment. I monitored progress, supported teammates when they needed clarity, and ensured our deliverables reflected the overall vision we agreed on. I consistently participated in discussions, provided updates, and made sure the team stayed coordinated through each stage of the assignment.

As the Ethics Lead, I ensured that our work reflected academic honesty, proper documentation, transparent coding practices, and respect for responsible data handling. I articulated ethical priorities early in the project, integrated them into our workflow, and verified that our final submission upheld those standards. I believe my work in this area strengthened the clarity, credibility, and integrity of the final product.

If I were to evaluate myself using the same 1–5 scale as the peer review rubric, I would score my contributions as follows:

Category	Score (1–5)	Notes
Collaboration	5	Consistently engaged, supported team alignment, stayed communicative.
Communication	5	Clear and consistent updates, ensured everyone understood deadlines and expectations.
Technical Contribution	5	Delivered the ethics framework, integrated it into the final product, and supported technical cohesion where needed.
Reliability	5	Met deadlines, organized project structure, and stayed accountable for team progress.
Overall	5	Fulfilled all responsibilities and strengthened the final outcome through leadership and organization.

Overall, I am satisfied with my performance. I contributed meaningfully to the direction, coordination, and ethical grounding of the project. I upheld the responsibilities of my role and supported both teammates in completing their technical work effectively. The project’s success reflects a collaborative effort, and I feel confident in the value I added to the final product.
