1. Project Manager – Bud Todd
   
Primary Focus: Coordination, leadership, and overall project management
Responsibilities:
•	Create and maintain the GitHub repository, ensuring all files, commits, and updates are properly organized.
•	Set meeting schedules and maintain communication via Microsoft Teams.
•	Track progress and deadlines according to the course project timeline.
•	Write and update the README.md and Group Charter documentation.
•	Lead the final presentation structure and coordinate slide creation.
•	Review all materials for completeness, clarity, and quality before submission.

2. AI Developer / Engineer – Jackson Stout

Primary Focus: Technical development and AI model design
Responsibilities:
•	Lead the design and simulation of the Driver Fatigue Detection System using computer vision concepts.
•	Research and describe the AI algorithm (e.g., CNN for image recognition of drowsiness indicators).
•	Create a mockup or prototype demo, showing how the system might function in a real-world application.
•	Assist with generating visuals for the final presentation (charts, diagrams, or code snippets).
•	Commit source files and visuals to the GitHub repository.

3. Data Scientist / Analyst – Paige DeMaris (pending participation)
Primary Focus: Data gathering, analysis, and performance metrics
Responsibilities:
•	Locate and prepare training datasets (e.g., driver images showing alert vs. drowsy states).
•	Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (balancing, resizing, labeling).
•	Analyze sample outputs or mock data to interpret performance metrics (accuracy, false positives).
•	Contribute to documentation explaining how data informs the AI model.

4. Data Researcher – Docial Veyee
Primary Focus: Dataset validation and ethical research support
Responsibilities:
•	Research open-source datasets or image repositories suitable for fatigue detection.
•	Verify data source credibility, licensing, and compliance with ethical standards.
•	Document all dataset sources and permissions in the GitHub repository.
•	Support the team by collecting references and providing summary reports for inclusion in the final project.
•	Assist the AI Ethicist in identifying potential privacy or consent concerns in datasets.

5. AI Ethicist / Researcher – Bud Todd
Primary Focus: Responsible AI design, ethical oversight, and transparency
Responsibilities:
•	Identify ethical issues related to privacy, data usage, and algorithmic bias.
•	Draft the Ethical Considerations section for GitHub and presentation slides.
•	Recommend strategies to reduce bias (e.g., diverse training data, transparency in alerts).
•	Review all documentation to ensure compliance with ethical and academic standards.
•	Support team members in writing a responsible, socially conscious final report.

Shared Team Responsibilities
•	Brainstorm and finalize product design and target audience.
•	Develop a 5–10 slide investor-style presentation with visuals, system workflow, ethical summary, and benefits.
•	Record the presentation (under 10 minutes) and upload it to GitHub.
•	Each member commits at least one file or update (data, visuals, or documentation) to GitHub to demonstrate participation.
