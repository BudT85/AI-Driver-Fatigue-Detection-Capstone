\# Ethics Statement



Ethics is the foundation of any technical project, not an afterthought. For this Data Structures project, ethical considerations guided how data was handled, how tools were used, and how the work was represented.



\## Accuracy and Integrity



The first responsibility was ensuring accuracy in all implementations. The algorithms and data structures used in this project were tested and verified to confirm they produced reliable and consistent results. Any errors that surfaced during development were addressed directly rather than minimized or ignored. Ethical work means acknowledging failures openly and correcting them with intention.



\## Transparency in Development



Clear, understandable code is an ethical obligation. Variable names, structure, and comments were written so another developer could follow the logic without confusion. Transparency prevents misuse, supports maintainability, and demonstrates respect for whoever interacts with the project in the future.



\## Academic Honesty



All work in this project reflects original effort. While research informed certain design decisions, outside sources were used only for learning, not copying. AI tools and other resources supported understanding but did not replace personal reasoning or problem-solving. This project represents my own knowledge, not borrowed work.



\## Privacy and Responsible Data Practices



Although the project did not use real personal data, it was developed with the same principles that protect users in real-world systems:  

\- Avoid collecting unnecessary data  

\- Prevent exposure of sensitive information  

\- Ensure structures operate safely and predictably  



Good habits in school translate to safe engineering in production environments.



\## Project Management Responsibility



As the project manager, maintaining ethical standards meant creating clear expectations, communicating changes, staying on schedule, and ensuring the submitted work matched the intent of the assignment. Leadership and ethics are inseparable in technical work.

Ethical practice is not a checkbox but the mindset that turns technical output into trustworthy engineering. This project was approached with that mindset from start to finish.
