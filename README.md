### **AI Focus Area:** Transportation

### **Project Overview**
The Driver Fatigue Detection System is an AI-powered vision application designed to alert drivers when they show signs of drowsiness. Using real-time camera input, the system monitors facial cues such as blinking frequency, head nodding, and eye closure to trigger alerts that help prevent accidents.

**AI/ML Integration**
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Training Data:** Open-source driver facial datasets (alert vs. drowsy)
- **Output:** Real-time alert system (sound, vibration, or visual cue)

---

### **Ethical Considerations**
- Protect driver **privacy** by limiting facial data storage.
- Address **bias** by using diverse datasets.
- Maintain **transparency** in how data is collected and processed.

---

### **Repository Structure**
- `group_charter.md` – Team roles and responsibilities  
- `data/` – Dataset references and research notes  
- `ethics/` – Ethical framework and AI policy notes  
- `slides/` – Final presentation deck and visuals  
- `media/` – Diagrams, screenshots, and mockups

---

### **Communication Plan**
- **Microsoft Teams:** Group communication and meetings (desktop + mobile)
- **GitHub Repository:** Central hub for documentation, updates, and submissions

---

### **Progress**
- Repository created and structured ✅  
- Group charter drafted and uploaded ✅  
- Communication plan established ✅  
- Awaiting dataset research and presentation slides 🚧
